The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species. The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.

Information about the original paper and usages of the dataset can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository -- Iris Data Set.

Just for reference, here are pictures of the three flowers species:
